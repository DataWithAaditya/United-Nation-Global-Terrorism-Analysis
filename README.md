# United-Nation-Global-Terrorism-Analysis

Project Summary -

Objective:
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to analyze and uncover insights from global terrorism incidents recorded in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). This analysis will help understand trends in terrorism, the most affected regions, attack methods, casualty rates, and other key patterns.

By conducting a structured EDA, this project aims to provide meaningful insights that could support security agencies, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions.

Key Steps in the Project:
- Data Collection & Understanding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using the UBM Rule
- Data Visualization & Insights
- Deployment-Ready Code
- Final Presentation & Report

Expected Outcome:
This project will deliver data-driven insights into terrorism trends, identifying key risk factors, vulnerable regions, and evolving attack patterns. The findings will be valuable for:

Policymakers – Formulating counter-terrorism policies.
